        <h3>Snowboarding</h3>
        <p>Part of my love of the outdoors is Snowboarding. I learned at the age of 14 that this was one of my passions during the winter time. Since then I have become a certifed instructor to teach
          how to Snowboard.</p>

        <h3>Gaming/Streaming</h3>
        <p>In my down time when I am not snowboaring, coding, or really doing anything. You can find me streaming games and having a good time with friends. I have always played videogames growing up,
          but as of recently I have started to stream and the best part about it is that my lovely wife does the same thing as well! Shes is the better streamer but its always fun to share a passion
          with the ones you love.</p>
